# Highlighting of Untranslated Items in Sitecore | Sitecore Language Version Gutter
https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/sitecore-translation-highlighting/

Custom icon in the gutter will indicate items that haven’t been translated yet (in other words, that don’t have language versions). By the way, you can choose the Gutter icon you like best. After the language has been changed, icons will update automatically across items in the Content Tree.

For example, when switching to German, we can see that the About page hasn’t been translated, while Contacts is in German.
